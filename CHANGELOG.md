# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- **NUTS region names** in `/lookup` responses: `nuts1_name`, `nuts2_name`, `nuts3_name` fields provide human-readable region names (Latin script) alongside NUTS codes. Names are sourced from the [GISCO NUTS CSV](https://gisco-services.ec.europa.eu/distribution/v2/nuts/csv/) distribution.
- `total_nuts_names` field in `/health` endpoint showing how many region names are loaded.
- NUTS names are cached in the SQLite DB (`nuts_names` table) for fast restarts.

### Notes

- **Backward compatible**: name fields default to `null` when names are unavailable. Existing clients that ignore unknown fields are unaffected.
- **Graceful degradation**: if the NUTS names CSV cannot be downloaded, all name fields are `null` but lookups continue to work normally. Pre-0.9.0 SQLite caches (without the `nuts_names` table) remain fully valid.
